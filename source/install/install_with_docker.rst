===========
With Docker
===========

| The easiest way to run RootDB is to use our officials Docker_ images, with compose_ plugin to start all services.



Download ready-to-use archives
==============================

| We provide different set of Docker ``env`` & ``compose`` configuration files in the table below.
| You will be able to quickly test locally.
|
| Simply download one of the `.zip` files in the table below, extract it, and open a terminal in the extracted directory.

   * - Services
     - Notes
     - Configuration files
   * - All-in-one
     - | Contains everything and works out-of-the box, **ideal to test in local**.
       | **TLDR** : Download the archive, extract, go into the extracted directory and run :

        .. code-block:: bash

            docker compose --env-file env up

       | RootdB will be available at : `localhost:8091`_

.. caution::

   | If the current user which will start services has a ``user id`` or ``group id`` different from ``1000``, you have to update docker ``env`` variables ``UID`` & ``GID`` with the right values.
   | To find-out your current ``user id`` & ``group id``, use the command ``id``

   * - ``DB_DATA_DIR``
     -  Relative or full path to the directory which (will) contains MariaDB data.
   * - ``API_ENV_PATHNAME``
     -  Relative or full path to API configuration file. ( ``api_env`` )
   * - ``FRONTEND_APP_CONFIG_PATHNAME``
     -  Relative or full path to frontend configuration file. ( ``app-config.js`` )

Before starting services
------------------------

For log, at this point you should have a directory named, for instance, ``rootdb``, and inside, these files and directories :

.. code-block:: bash

    .
    ├── [drwxr-xr-x] db
    ├── [-rw-r--r--] api_env
    ├── [-rw-r--r--] app-config.js
    ├── [-rw-r--r--] docker-compose.yml
    └── [-rw-r--r--] env


Starting services
-----------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker compose --env-file env -f docker-compose.yml up

| Once containers are up and running the application should take ~6s to initialize, for the first launch. (once images are downloaded)
| And you should see :

.. code-block:: default

    rootdb              | [16-Jun-2022 21:43:49] NOTICE: fpm is running, pid 1
    rootdb              | [16-Jun-2022 21:43:49] NOTICE: ready to handle connections

.. tip::

    It's now time to :doc:`setup the application<../setup/rootdb_setup>`.
