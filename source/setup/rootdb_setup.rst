=============
RootDB setup
=============

----------------
Super-admin user
----------------

| First you will have to setup the ``super-admin`` user.
| The ``super-admin`` user is the only one account authorized to setup licenses.
| You will have to change the default password first.

.. tip::

    Default password for ``super-admin`` user is ``rootdbadmin``

--------
Licenses
--------

| Then, you will have to obtain a valid license in order to use RootDB.
| Get one from `RootDB website`_
| Once you have your license, simply copy-past it in the text area, then click on ``Add`` and finally ``Validate``

---------------------------------
Before starting your first report
---------------------------------

| We highly recommend you to not use RootDB as ``super-admin`` user.
| You should setup a generic developer user with these roles : ``admin, developer``

| Then you have to add a `connector` which is basically a connection to a database.
